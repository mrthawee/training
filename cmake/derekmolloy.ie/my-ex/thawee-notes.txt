my-ex: this is my own attempt to create CMakeLists for codes in 3 directories

./src/ : C/C++ source files 
./inc/ : C/C++ header files
./utest/ : unit test code/files
./build/ : where CMakeLists.txt is
           - mkdir out under build/ first
           - cd out
           - cmake .. 
           - now we got all generated files under build/out
           - so we can remove all generated file by rm -rf out/
.
|-- inc
|   \-- Student.h
|-- src
|   \-- Student.cpp
|-- utest
|   \-- libtest.cpp
|-- build
    \-- CMakeLists.txt
