ex2: cmake for files in include/ and src/ directories to create an executable (main() included)

Here are the needed files and directories for this example

.
|-- CMakeLists.txt
|-- include 
|   \-- Student.h
\-- src
    |-- Student.cpp
    \-- mainapp.cpp

For better grouping off cmake generated files \build should be created
Then, 
cd build/
cmake ..
make

rm -rf build/ will remove all generated files and executable testStudent

NOTE:  if adding new source files, must run cmake again first
